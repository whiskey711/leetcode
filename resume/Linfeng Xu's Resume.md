## Programming Experience
### Telemetry ECG Monitoring System
*University of Victoria*, Jan 2019 - Dec 2021

System function: Target user clinics, through the project's client, can book long-duration ECG monitoring for their patients and can view ECG in real time during the monitoring process.

1. Windows front end
    - Developed WinForm client with **C#**.
    - Designed and developed client interface, registration and login system, patient information and appointment management block, and ECG animation block. **.NET** framework and third-party custom controllers were used in the development.
    - Designed and developed a download function while the client is running in the background. The client downloads patient and ECG data in **JSON** format to the local hard disk. The download is connected to the server through **RESTful API**.
2. Server and database
    - Built server and database with **Java** and **MySQL**.
    - Developed authentication and authorization for server. Server assigns a **JSON Web Token** to the visitor who logged in. All requests involving data require JWT authentication.
    - Developed various **RESTful API** for client to access, such as creating, reading, updating and deleting patient information and appointments.
    - Used **Spring Data JPA** framework to generate MySQL queries to do CRUD operations.
